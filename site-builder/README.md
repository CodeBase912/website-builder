# WebX - website builder

[Live Site](http://localhost:3000)

A Full Stack web application that allows users to create a static website using drag and drop and then download the resulting HTML and CSS files. Users need to login to create a website. I bootstrapped this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on the front end and built the backend REST API from scratch using object-oriented PHP & MySQL.

**Note: The work on this project is still in progress!**
